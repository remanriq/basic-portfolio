<p>Hello my name is Rosa Manriquez and I grew up in Soledad california which is located in Monterey County. I moved to Los Angeles three years ago due to a job offer. Presently, I am a behavior therapist, so I work with children and adults who have developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>On my off time, I enjoy listening to music, reading personal development/business books, and traveling. Also, I am a part-time health and fitness coach. I believe living a healthy life is key to having a happy and exceptional life.</p>
